### Question: 1
one (array, target) must be used to call the target function.
I inserted an error if it was impossible to reach the target with the sum and 2 elements of the array.
the function allows 2 equal numbers to be used, but each element of the array will be used only once.
the same element of the array is not being used 2 times.
if you do not want to repeat 2 real numbers, target function 2 has been created.

Errors:

Error-01 - a target number was inserted whose sum of two
elements other than Array x cannot be met.


### Question: 2
When calling the balancing function with a string, the return will be answered if it is balanced 'yes' or 'no'.
